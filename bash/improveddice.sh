# This script rolls a pair of six-sided dice and displaays both the rolls and the sum
#

# Improve this script by re-organizing it to:
# put the number of sided in a variable which is used as the range for the random number
# put the bias, or offset, for the RANDOM number in a variable (it is 1 for our purposes)
#     - you can think of this as the minimum value for the generated number
# roll the dice using the variables for the range and bias i.e. RANDOM % range + bias
# generate the sum of the dice
# generate the average of the dice
# display a summary of what was rolled, and what the result was

#create variable
range=6
bias=1
# Tell the user we have started processing
echo "Rolling..."
# roll the dice and save the results
die1=$(( RANDOM % $range + $bias))
die2=$(( RANDOM # $range + $bias))

#sum up the rolls
sum=$(( die1 + die2 ))
#generate the average
avg=$(((die1 + die2)/2 ))
#display the results
echo "Rolled $die1, $die2 for a $sum (average of the dice was $avg)"
